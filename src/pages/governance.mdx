# AusTrakka Governance

AusTrakka's governance framework ensures proper oversight and management of genomic data sharing across Australian jurisdictions while maintaining data security and appropriate access controls.

## Operational Governance

The AusTrakka Governance is operated by the
<a href="https://www.cdgn.org.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">**Communicable Diseases Genomics Network (CDGN)**</a>
and is maintained by the AusTrakka Development Team at the University of Melbourne.

Agreement on data governance for AusTrakka covers:
- Sharing of pathogen sequences/isolates
- Minimal metadata with pre-defined recipients
- Established partnerships with the Office of Health Protection
- CDGN public health laboratory members as primary contributors of genomic sequencing data

## Advisory Structure

Currently, the **AusTrakka Advisory Group** comprises representatives from leading genomics public health laboratories in:
- Queensland
- Victoria
- New South Wales

This group is responsible for:
- Overseeing the AusTrakka National Analysis Team
- Managing platform structure and workforce
- Facilitating analysis requests
- Reporting AusTrakka outputs

## Governance Frameworks

### SARS-CoV-2 Framework

The Framework for SARS-CoV-2 data sharing and analysis using AusTrakka was rapidly developed early in the COVID-19 pandemic to provide:
- Mechanisms for rapid data sharing
- Genomic analysis under various operational situations
- Support within and between jurisdictions and nationally

This Framework formalized endorsement from:
- Public health laboratories
- Public health units represented on key Australian Government committees

It established protocols for rapidly sharing all SARS-CoV-2 genomics data to the AusTrakka platform through nominated public health laboratories for national real-time surveillance.

The SARS-CoV-2 Framework was **endorsed by AHPPC on Thursday, 1 October 2020**.

### Expanded National Framework

The Governance Framework for National Genomic Surveillance in AusTrakka is currently under review and endorsement by:
- Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA)
- Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN)
- Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC)

This expanded framework applies the same principles in data custodianship and describes mechanisms for data sharing for:
- National surveillance
- Outbreak investigation of pathogens identified as priority by national committees
