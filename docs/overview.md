# About AusTrakka

In 2020, AusTrakka was rapidly developed in response to key reports to the **Office of Health Protection and Response** on the need to better facilitate public health genomics data sharing and analysis in **Australia and New Zealand**. AusTrakka serves as **Australiaâ€™s national genomics surveillance platform** for **SARS-CoV-2** and as a coordinator of **genomics outbreak investigations** across jurisdictions.

## National Genomics Data Sharing

All state and territory **public health laboratories** upload genomic sequences and agreed epidemiological metadata to AusTrakka on a **dedicated server** for **nationally aggregated genomics analysis** and **visualisation of sequences**.

- **Access Control:** Managed at a user level, overseen by the **Communicable Diseases Genomics Network (CDGN)** and the **Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN)**.
- **Data Security:** Ensures secure data sharing while maintaining **custodianship with the submitting laboratory**.

## Public Health Surveillance & Bioinformatics

For **public health surveillance**, AusTrakka supports:

- **Bioinformatic analysis**
- **Genomic epidemiology**
- **Reporting of genomic findings** within and between jurisdictions


## Platform Functions & Architecture

The **AusTrakka platform** accepts **sequence and epidemiological data** from public health laboratories and performs several functions.

Outlined below is:

1. The **platform architecture and functions**
