# About AusTrakka

In 2020, AusTrakka was rapidly developed in response to key reports to the **Office of Health Protection and Response**
on the need to better facilitate public health genomics data sharing and analysis in **Australia and New Zealand**.
AusTrakka serves as **Australiaâ€™s national genomics surveillance platform** for **SARS-CoV-2** and
as a coordinator of genomics outbreak investigations across jurisdictions.

## National Genomics Data Sharing

All state and territory public health laboratories upload genomic sequences and agreed epidemiological metadata to AusTrakka on a **dedicated server** for **nationally aggregated genomics analysis** and **visualisation of sequences**.

- **Access Control:** Managed at a user level, overseen by the
 <a href="https://www.cdgn.org.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">**Communicable Diseases Genomics Network (CDGN)**</a> and
  the <a href='https://www.health.gov.au/committees-and-groups/phln' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">**Public Health Laboratory Network (PHLN)**</a>.
- **Data Security:** Ensures secure data sharing while maintaining custodianship with the submitting laboratory.

## Public Health Surveillance & Bioinformatics

For **public health surveillance**, AusTrakka supports:

- **Bioinformatic analysis**
- **Genomic epidemiology**
- **Reporting of genomic findings** within and between jurisdictions


## Platform Functions & Architecture

The AusTrakka platform accepts sequence and epidemiological data from public health laboratories and performs several functions.

Outlined below is:
